# Choreograph a Dance

```python-template
hoc.dance(Dance.Move1)
```

## Choreographing the dance
Help Instructor Welsen finish choreographing their dance. The function ``||hoc:hoc.dance()||`` is used to set the dance move you want performed. It takes a single parameter that defines the move. Try running the following code. 

```python
hoc.dance(Dance.Move1)
hoc.dance(Dance.Move2)
hoc.dance(Dance.Move3)
hoc.dance(Dance.Move4)
```

## Complete the Challenge 
Now that you know how to use the ``||hoc:hoc.dance()||`` function, see if you could figure out the order of the final 4 dance moves Instructor Welsen needs to finish his choreography. See the hint for all available dance parameters.
