# Choose the costumes

```python-template
hoc.costume(HeadWear.Knight_Helmet, MidWear.Cowboy_Shirt, LowerWear.Ballerina_Tutu)
```

## Choosing the costumes
It looks like there's a second lock made of iron. You'll need to figure out which costume pieces it requires. Use the ``||hoc:hoc.costume()||`` function to open the lock. Set the ``||hoc:HeadWear, MidWear, and LowerWear||`` of the costumes.
