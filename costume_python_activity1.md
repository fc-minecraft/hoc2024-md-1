# Choose the costumes

```python-template
hoc.costume(HeadWear.Knight_Helmet, MidWear.Cowboy_Shirt, LowerWear.Ballerina_Tutu)
```

## Choosing the costumes
Look at the lock to see what numbers it's displaying and then use the closet to find which costume pieces matche that number. Once you've matched them up, use the ``||hoc:hoc.costume()||`` function to open the lock. Set the ``||hoc:HeadWear, MidWear, and LowerWear||`` of the costumes.

#### ~ tutorialhint
Make sure to set the numbers inside the closet to match the numbers on the lock, and then code that costume set.
